# Pludata.io Framework

This repository contains all the main node modules used in Plugdata.io products and is aimed to be help anybody who wants to easily create robust and performant web applications.

# Philosofy

- __Typescript__: We like how Typescript has been evolving during the last years and it provide us with tools to create consistent and organized projects.
- __Low overhead__: One of the few problems we see with the JS ecosystem is the high volume of libraries required even for the simplest things, so we try to minimize it by choosing libraries with the same philosophy and always trying to be as close to Node JS as possible
- __Consistent internal API__: Another problem with nowadays projects is that every library usually has a different way of doing things: configuration, execution (callbacks, promises, etc) and not always has a good support for Typescript. We try our best to create a consistent API for all functionality, it being: logs, scheduled jobs, database, APIs, etc. This can be done thanks to our custom dependency injection (see more below), configuration interfaces and extensive usage of decorators.
- __Performance__: This connects directly to our low overhead philosophy, in all our decisions we always take performance as a high priority point. We'll keep track of it by constantly updating and running benchmarks against other libraries and ourselves.
- __Versioning__: As it is a common practice in npm packages we'll use a [semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for all our packages, and all the packages will have the same version. This means if the current version is 2.0.1 and a new patch is released, then all the packages will upgrade to version 2.0.2. This also means that we'll have to coordinate all our projects when deciding to release a new minor o major version, so all of them take advantage of it.

# Modules

Bellown is shown a list of all node modules with the real npm package, a little description and links to useful information.

## @plugdata/core

Contains the main functionality that any Node JS might need, som of it would be:

- __Dependency injection__: It's a custom implementation based on an decorator syntax, and it will be the cornerstone of all our modules and products. This section is related to our consistent API philosofy, since everything will be managed and configurated by the container. It's influenced by (typedi)[https://github.com/typestack/typedi], but with extended functionality to meet our needs.
- __Configuration__: There will be a main configuration file wich will have everything needed for other packages configuration, custom implementations and future products. It's based on JSONs files, wich will be able to reference enviroment variables and have different versions for different enviroments (productio, development, etc.). 
- __Logs__: For all our logging we'll use (pino)[https://github.com/pinojs/pino] since it fit's our philosophy and has a great conectivity with other products such as (Elastic logs)[https://www.elastic.co/es/solutions/logging]
- __Http/s Client__: We have a lightweight http/s client that is a simple promisified wrapper of Nodejs (Http/s client)[https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_get_options_callback] with easy methods to make REST JSON calls.
- __Events__: It's an adaptation of (EventEmitter3)[https://github.com/primus/eventemitter3#readme] to our dependency injection system. It has almost the same API than the (Node JS events)[https://nodejs.org/api/events.html] but with some additions like contexts, so it won't be neccesarry to call `.bind(this)`, and some unnecesary methods removed for better performance.
- __Scheduled jobs__: For job scheduling we have adapted a simple (cron)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron] library to our dependency injection and event system so you can easily create them and listen for all events if some loggin o database insertion is needed.
- __Object validator__: An extensible and lightweigth object validator based on (superstruct)[https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/superstruct] modified to have a more comprehensive API
- __Object transformation__: 
- __Utils__: During our development of several projects we've been gathering some common usage utils, mostly for objects and promises manipulation, and other NodeJS wrappers for things like file system calls. We'll be updating these utils as development progresses.
